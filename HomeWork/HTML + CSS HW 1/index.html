            <li>Diet: Dolphins are carnivores and feed on a variety of fish, squid, and crustaceans depending on the species and the habitat they live in.
            </li>
            <li>Echolocation: Dolphins use echolocation to locate prey and navigate through their environment. They emit high-frequency sounds and then listen for the echoes that bounce back to determine the location of objects around them.
